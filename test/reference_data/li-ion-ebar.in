! - All activation energies are given as Ea/R, and have units of K
! - The solid-state diffusion activation energies are set to zero to
!   remind the user that the superposition integral is only valid
!   for a constant diffusion coefficient.0 The variable diffusion
!   coefficient feature should be activated to use nonzero values
!   of the solid-state activation energies.
